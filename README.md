# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi there — I'm **@pediotroni**  
A curious mind wandering through the world of code, crypto, and controlled chaos.

## 🧠 About Me

- 💻 Passionate about **C/C++ programming** — mostly using **Embarcadero C++Builder** (and yeah... _definitely not into Delphi_ 😄)
- 🔐 Currently exploring the **Crypto world**, working on **serious and exciting software projects** in this evolving space.
- 🌱 Learning? Well, kinda **nothing and everything** at the same time.
- 💡 Interested in the **low-level**, the **weird**, and the **clever** things that make computers tick.
- 🤝 Not actively looking for collaboration, but hey — you never know. If something truly _interesting_ comes along, hit me up.
- 📫 How to reach me? That's a mystery... for now.

## 🧩 Random Bits

- I enjoy solving deep technical puzzles.
- I don’t believe in overcomplication — **simplicity is power**.
- My repos may look quiet, but the storm brews beneath the surface.  
  Stay tuned.
